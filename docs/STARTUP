Running irssi-xmpp:
===================

Usage:
    /LOAD xmpp

Simply load the module in irssi. Currently you cannot load it automatically,
unless using a script or something like that.

The module should be placed in "~/.irssi/modules/", or you should load it with
the full path.

You can unload it using:
    /UNLOAD xmpp

Connection:
===========

Usage:
    /XMPPCONNECT [-ssl] [-host <host>] [-port <port>]
                 <jid>[/<resource>] <password>

The "jid" is your Jabber ID (something like "username@server"). You can add
"/<resource>" at the end of the "jid" to set your own resource.

Please note that irssi-xmpp doesn't support SRV record (yet), so you must
specify the host with the parameter "-host".

You can also use /XMPPSERVER to replace the current connection. See the FAQ
if you want to automatically connect to the server at startup

Automation:
===========

If you want to automatically load the module and connect to an account,
take a look at the FAQ. Everything is explained in it.

Register:
=========

You can register an account directly with irssi-xmpp using the command
/XMPPREGISTER. But it will not register an account on a virtual domain.
So don't use this feature yet, and wait until it is ready.
