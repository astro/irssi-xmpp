MUC commands:
=============

/JOIN <room@server>[/<nick>]
    Join a room. If your nick is not specified, the value of the setting "nick"
    will be used as your nick in this room.
    Unlike irssi default behaviour (that you can pass a list of channels
    separated with a comma), only one room can be passed to this command!

/PART [<room@server>] [<reason>]
    Leaves a room.

/QUERY <nick>
    Opens a query window with the nick in the room.

/NICK [<room@server>] <nick>
    Changes your nick in a specific room.

/TOPIC [<room@server>] <topic>
    Changes the topic of the room, if you have the right to do it.

/NAME
    Lists the nicks in the room.

/INVITE <jid>[/<resource>] [<room@server>]
/INVITE <name> [<room@server>]
     Invites the specified contact to the current or specified room.

Administration commands:
========================

Currently, you cannot manage a room with irssi-xmpp.
