1.1 How can I automatically load irssi-xmpp at irssi startup ?

Simply put "irssi-xmpp" in your startup file (~/.irssi/startup):
    echo "irssi-xmpp" >> ~/.irssi/startup

1.2 How can I automatically connect to my account at irssi startup ?

You can put these things in your config file (The config file can be found
here : "~/.irssi/config"):

To create a XMPP network, add to chatnets section:
  <network> = {
    type = "XMPP";
    nick = "<jid>";
  };

Then you can add this at the end of the servers section:
  {
    address = "<address>";
    port="<port>";
    use_ssl = "{yes|no}";
    chatnet = "<network>";
    password = "<password>";
    autoconnect = "{yes|no}";
  };

Or in irssi, you can type this:
    /SERVER ADD -xmppnet <network> <address> <port> <password> <jid>

If 0 is specified as port, the default port will be used (5222 for a regular
connection or 5223 for SSL).

Now you can connect to your jabber account by typing:
    /CONNECT <network>
Or just restart irssi if you have set autoconnect to yes.

2. General:
===========

2.1 Why the lagmeter is not working ?

The server need to support the XEP-0199 (XMPP Ping). If it doesn't
support it, the lagmeter won't work.

If your server support the XMPP Ping, maybe you didn't add the composing
item in the statusbar. Take a look at the file GENERAL (section
"Composing in the statusbar:).

3. Scripting:
=============

3.1 How can I use or write scripts with irssi-xmpp ?

...

3.2 My script seems to be incompatible with irssi-xmpp and throws warnings 
such as: Can't locate object method "xxx" via package "Irssi::Xmpp::Server".
How can I get rid of that ?

Basicly, it's because the script is IRC-specific and won't work with an
XMPP server. Try to add a condition in the functions of your script to
verify if the server is an IRC server and simply return if it is not.

4. Themes:
==========

4.1 How can I change the theme of the messages of irssi-xmpp ?

In the same way you can change the theme of the messages of irssi. Take
a look at the source file src/fe-common/module-formats.c to see the
whole list of irssi-xmpp messages.
